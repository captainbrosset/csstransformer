csstransformer
==============

This CSS Transform Visualizer tool allows you to experiment with CSS transforms by entering any transform expression and visualizing the result of that transform on an element.

The tool shows both the un-transformed and transformed elements, giving you better understanding of how transforms work.

You can move and resize the element freely as well as move the transform origin too.

TODO
====
* add a non symetrical shape in the element and transformed element, so it's easy to see if it's upside down or mirrored
* hold shift when resizing the element should resize it propoertionally
