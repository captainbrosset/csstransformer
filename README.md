csstransformer
==============

This CSS Transform Visualizer tool allows you to experiment with CSS transforms by entering any transform expression and visualizing the result of that transform on an element.

The tool shows both the un-transformed and transformed elements, giving you better understanding of how transforms work.

You can move and resize the element freely as well as move the transform origin too.

TODO
====
* move origin proportionally when shape is resized (if it's at center/center, it should stay at center/center even when resizing)
* show dimensions and positions labels while moving/dragging (for center, show center/top/bottom/... labels when at 0/100%)
